Code and I have always had a very pleasant but distant relationship. For years now I have dabbled with code, and it has always been something I thought was just for fun. Learning about code became kind of like a safe place, when I felt stressed or frustrated with my current job I would watch some code videos. When I felt bored I would start an online class or give a go at some random coding challenge. When I felt inquisitive I would research terms from the coding world just so I could know what it meant. These years of dipping my toes into the coding swimming pool showed me how much I loved this field, and my continous return showed me that this was what I really wanted.

Eventually, I realized that I had hit a plateau in my code understanding. I was struggling to create the connections between concepts and that was holding me back. Combining the adoration I had developed for code, with my eagerness to get past this learning hump, I came to the conclusion that I did in fact want to learn software engineering fully, and I wanted to make this hobby into a career. 

I think tech was something I was always supposed to pursue, but for some reason it just took me this long to realize it. And after all this time, I am now writing my first Flatiron blog post, the day right before I start the online software engineering program with my fellow cohorts! Regardless of how long it has taken, I am really happy that I have finally made the decision to take this leap into this beautiful exciting and vibrant field, and I'm really glad to be doing it with Flatiron School.
