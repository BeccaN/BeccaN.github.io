It is so surreal to me that my Flatiron learning journey is coming to an end. The first blog I wrote was an explanation on why I decided to start this journey [Why I Chose Code](https://beccan.github.io/why_i_chose_code). Going back and reading this first blog post was incredibly cathartic. I had expressed feeling like an outsider looking into the coding world, but now after 10 months of learning, I do feel like I am part of the coding world, but I think I was part of it then too! I thought that my lack of understanding a technical concept kept me on the outside looking in. Now after learning various different tools I know that isn't accurate, because I am part of the coding world AND still learning and overcoming new "learning humps". FORTUNATELY, the "learning humps" will never cease, and that is incredibly exciting! I will always be learning and pushing myself to new heights, and that is why I chose to pursue this field. 

I think this lesson is possibly the most important lesson I learned during my time with Flatiron. Before starting Flatiron I, like many other "coding newbies", spent a lot of time trying to find the absolute "best path" and "best programming languages to learn" to get a job in coding. I see now that this is rediculous, my "to learn" list and coding tutorial playlist are longer than ever! There is no "best path", you just start learning, and keep learning. 

Another incredibly important lesson Flatiron taught me was to not be afraid to reach out to the coding community when I needed it. No one can do it alone, we all at some point need to turn to someone else and ask for help, this isn't a sign of weakness, this is a sign of strength. Moving forward I can't wait to get more interconnected with the coding community  and attending meetups to get to know more coders! One of my most favorite parts of Flatiron was the group/pod meetings, I loved being able to connect with the other students and overcome a technical task together. This also helped iterate the above lesson, that WE are all always learning together. 

I am so happy I chose to attend Flatiron, I feel more confident in my ability to learn something new and succeed. And now that I enter the job searching phase, I can't wait to work with my career coach and start my new career!
