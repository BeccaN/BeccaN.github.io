Wow, can't believe its been almost two months since I started the part time software engineering program. After completing this first project there are so many things that I have learned, about code and the material, as well as myself. My project utilized the NY Times Books API, specifically I was scraping for the current hardcover fiction bestsellers list. The user would be prompted with the bestsellers list and then be asked which book they wished to learn more about. As simple as this might sound initially, I still found myself incredibly anxious and lost on how to start. Of course I did my fair share of anxious procrastination at the start, but I feel like I learned some valuable lessons that could potentially help others when they get to their CLI project!

### 1. Watch the walkthrough video...

Okay, maybe for some this sounds silly, but I have a tendency of jumping into things at weird times and not giving myself enough prep before starting. If you are also one of these people, do yourself a favor and force yourself to stop everything and watch at least one CLI project walkthrough video series all the way through. Seriously, kick back for the first day and just watch the videos, you don't even need to absorb everything, you can always come back to it later if you need a reminder on something. 

### 2. Really look at the API or website you are scraping...

Especially if it is a website you are scraping, make sure you read ahead and look at everything. Make sure the CSS selectors are clear and you aren't getting yourself into something too crazy. Read through the API documentation and try to envision yourself working with it. If its feeling off, its probably for a reason, so just move on and find something else.

### 3. Write everything out in plain english...

After I had made my flowchart and I got the skeleton of my project completed I felt stuck. Suddenly everything I had been learning for the past 6 weeks went out the window and I knew nothing all over again. To keep myself from getting stagnate I started commenting out in each file 'what it was' and 'what it would do' in relation to my project. I wrote these sentences out multiple times, rephrasing and fixing wording each time. After I had my comments written out I felt way more comfortable!

### 4. Test, test and test...

Run the program and test often! Read every puts line out loud and test for every possible outcome. I would also include in this to commit your changes to github regularly as well. I was constantly running the program and testing everything out, it helped to make me feel more secure. I felt like I always had a clear idea of where I was, and what I had to do next. 

### 5. Believe that you can do it (cheesy)!

This project felt huge because it was the first time I was putting together everything I had learned so far. I didn't have the comfort of the Learn lab specs to helpfully guide me through every problem and let me know what to do next. You are really combining all of your resources and building a whole thing all by yourself. But don't be freaked out, it is totally doable! Use everything you can to help yourself out and push forward!

It was a challenge for sure, but pleasantly challenging. I know feel so much more confident in my abilities as a coder. I feel like I better understand how I work through projects, and I also know what to look out for in the next project.
